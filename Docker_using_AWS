DOCKER:

Docker is a technology that allows you to build, run, test, and deploy distributed applications that are based on Linux containers. 
Amazon ECS uses Docker images in task definitions to launch containers on EC2 instances in your clusters.

To install Docker on an Amazon Linux instance:

1. Launch an instance with the Amazon Linux AMI. For more information, see [Launching an Instance](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/launching-instance.html) in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.

2. Connect to your instance. For more information, see [Connect to Your Linux Instance](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstances.html) in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.

3. Update the installed packages and package cache on your instance.

```[ec2-user ~]$ sudo apt-get update```
4. Install Docker.

```[ec2-user ~]$ sudo apt-get install docker```
5. Start the Docker service.

```[ec2-user ~]$ sudo service docker start```
